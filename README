# neeo_driver_sony_bravia


This app brings NEEO and Sony Bravia Android TV's together, it may work with other bravia but the main functionality is pulled from the sony-bravia-tv-remote npm package
It requires a number of modifications to get working within your environment and the TV must be distinctly defined as per the instructions. 

See here for any initial settings you wil need to make to your tv https://www.npmjs.com/package/sony-bravia-tv-remote
I have also noticed that after a tv update you may need to make these changes again.

If you have more than one tv you wish to control then this can be done with some minor modifications as per the sections which are commented out
The NEEO Remote can be (Pre)ordered at: https://neeo.com/
Please note that this is not an official NEEO app made by NEEO and there will be no support from NEEO concerning this App.

Instructions
